# External Merge Sort

I created this repository to practice creating this algorithm, and its sub components (merge sort, exporting array into file). This was essentially created just for fun.

Procedure:
- Follow specifications of the merge sort algorithms, without looking at the example code.
  - [External Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/external-sorting/)
- If stuck for more tan 30 minutes without progress, read the part of the solution I am stuck in to make progress.
- Document learning on GoodNotes.
